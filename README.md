# Ethereum DApp Supply Chain Tracker

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate some competency in writing smart contracts and testing them thoroughly. We also learned some basic UML diagram and how to design a basic DApp. The smart contracts we wrote were deployed to the Rinkeby Test Network and the contract address is shown below

## Write Up
The writeup is hosted in the root folder and can be downloaded as a pdf

## Libraries
The Roles library (built internally) was used in addition to the npm modules truffle-hd-wallet-provider and dotenv.

## IPFS

I do plan on uploading this DApp to the IPFS soon, but as of first submission, it is not available there.

## Contract Address

0x61747E15ddfF3B48B3b803a44821A25152Df871C

## Versions

Solidity: v0.4.24
Truffle: v5.0.25
Web3.js: v1.0.0-beta37
Node: v10.15.3

## Running the application

after the files have been downloaded:
- run npm install to install necessary node modules
- npm run dev to run the front-end of the application
- make sure Metamask is up and running with Rinkeby Test Network selected!
